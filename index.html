    <h3>Wyoming Bentonite</h3>
    <p>
      Wyoming has 70 percent of the world’s known supply of bentonite, which is also produced in Greece, Japan, Italy, Brazil, Romania, Germany, Mexico, Argentina, Spain, India, Hungary, Poland, Canada, Turkey, and Cyprus. However, Wyoming’s bentonite has unique characteristics that are rarely found anywhere else. It can swell up to 16 times its original size and absorbs up to 10 times its own weight in water
      Wyoming bentonite is the result of chemical changes in ancient volcanic ash, which originated in western Wyoming and Idaho about 120 million years ago during the late Cretaceous period

    <h3>New Zealand Bentonite</h3>
    <p>
      New Zealand's largest bentonite quarry. Worked in the summer months, and processed at a plant in Coalgate.
      Bentonite in the area in its natural state is non swelling, but is processed with soda ash, to change it to a swelling variety. The clay is sold as a number of products, including as a fine powder for a growth medium and fertilizer, skin care and cosmetics, inhibiting the ingress of water into bore holes, grouting, civil and geotechnical applications such as clay liners in tunnels, land capping, land fill cell construction, and liners to dams, underground slurry walls, and barriers, paper making, and the treatment of waste effluent.

    <h3>Greece Bentonite</h3>
    <p>
      The clay minerals bentonite and kaolinite inform us whether the volcanic fluids were alkaline or acid: bentonite on Milos was formed by the leaching of porous, fragmentary rocks by seawater mixed with hot volcanic, alkaline waters. When the same porous rocks were also leached by hot, acid fluids, a blanket of kaolinite was deposited on the earlier bentonite. The bentonite of Milos is of very high quality. Three distinct groups of bentonite appear on Milos with slightly different properties: the deposits of Zoulias- Aspro Horio-Tsantili, the largest deposit of Angeria and Koufi, and finally the deposits of Ano and Kato Komia, Rema and Mavrogiannos. Greece is the second largest producer of bentonite after USA. Most of the country’s production comes from Milos.

        <h3>India Bentonite</h3>
        <p>
          The Indian bentonite is essentially plastic clay with flexible viscosity. It contains almost 85% montmorillonite, a clay mineral. However, the name of the mineral refers to the place in the USA where it was first found. The natural clay is of a great commercial significance. Its bleaching property is often similar to the fuller’s earth. The wide usage of this healing clay is for bleaching and hence also known as bleaching clay.
